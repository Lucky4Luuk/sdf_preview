Use a combination of rendering proper distance fields using bounding boxes and a low resolution 3D texture of the scene, so I can do both the bounding boxes idea for good performance and clean distance fields, but I can also do proper shadowing, GI and possibly reflections (depends on the quality, but seems good enough)
